### Introduction ###
Welcome to my take home code test project! This project 
implements a REST service, as described in the project
specification document. It requires Python 3.5+ or PyPy3.
It uses the TinyDB Python package for data storage. Sample 
test database files are included with my code.

### Installation Instructions ###
* unzip the take-home-test.zip file
* In a terminal window, cd to the take-home-test directory.
* run pip install -r requirements.txt
* run python user_records_api.py
The REST service will now be running and accepting connections
at http://localhost:5000.

### Integration test instructions ###
I have put together a small integration test suite that runs in
the Postman REST client. To use it, please follow these 
instructions.

* Install Postman, if needed. (https://www.postman.com/)
* Run Postman.
* Select File -> Import on the menu.
* Select the File tab, then the Upload Files button. Navigate to 
the test folder and select the .json file there. Click the 
Import button.
* Click the three dots next to User Records integration test on 
the sidebar. 
* Select Run collection from the menu.
* Press the Run User Records integration test button.
* Postman will run the integration test.
